Any recognized political party or any group of persons contesting as independent candidates (hereinafter referred to as an 'independent group') may for the purpose of any election of Members of Parliament for any electoral district, submit one nomination paper setting out the names of such number of candidates as is equivalent to the number of members to be elected for that electoral district, increased by three. Each elector whose name appears in the register of electors shall be entitled to only one vote notwithstanding that his name appears in the electoral register in more than one electoral district.

Where after the declaration of the election of members as provided in paragraph (8) of this Article there are one or more members yet to be declared elected, such member or members shall be declared elected by reference to the remainder of the votes referred to in paragraph (8), each remainder being arranged in descending order of magnitude and the party or group having the highest of such remainders being entitled to have a further candidate declared elected and so on, until all the members to be elected are declared elected. Where the number of votes polled by each recognized political party or independent group is less than the resulting number referred to in paragraph (7) of this Article the party or group which has polled the highest number of votes shall be entitled to have the candidate who has secured the highest number of preferences among the candidates nominated by such party or group declared elected and if there are one or more members yet to be declared elected in respect of that electoral district the provisions of that paragraph shall mutatis mutandis, apply until all the members to be elected are declared elected.

The Commissioner of Elections shall by Notification published in the Gazette specify the number of members each recognized political party or independent group is entitled to have declared elected under this Article. Every recognized political party or independent group shall be entitled to nominate such number of persons as is equivalent to the number of members specified by the Commissioner of Elections under paragraph (2) of this Article to be declared elected as Members of Parliament, from a list of persons who have in terms of Article 99, been set out as candidates for any electoral district or nominated as National List candidates by such party or group at that General Election. The names of persons nominated under paragraph (3) of this Article shall be sent by the Secretary of the recognized political party or by a person authorized by the independent group, to the Commissioner of Elections within one week of the publication of the Notification referred to in paragraph (2) and the Commissioner shall declare such persons elected as Members of Parliament.

The vacancy occurring in the membership of Parliament by reason of such declaration shall be filled in the manner provided in paragraph (iii).
